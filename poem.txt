This is a poem
Anything can be
All you need is words
As you can see!

You can add some more
For it's what you do
When words are for all (as is the color indigo)
But paragraphs, for two.

Writing's for all,
when it's all said and done.
Even if it sucks,
as long as it's fun!

...and UNICORNS!
...and PONIES!
